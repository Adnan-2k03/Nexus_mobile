This screenshot captures the primary interface where players discover match opportunities in real-time.
The Match Feed is divided into two tabs serving distinct use cases: - LFG (Looking for
Group): Players seeking teammates for cooperative gameplay—whether for ranked matches,
casual games, or tournament practice - LFO (Looking for Opponent): Players or teams
seeking opponents for scrimmages, 1v1 challenges, or competitive practice
Each match card displays the game title with username where other could checkout user’s
skills by going through his profile portfolio. The post contains description where creater could
pu t: required skill tier, scheduled time, region, and current roster status etc.
The "All Regions" dropdown allows filtering by geographic location (NA, EU, ASIA, OCE,
etc.) to ensure players find teammates with acceptable ping/latency for competitive play.
Most importantly, the feed updates in real-time. When another player posts a match anywhere
in the world, it appears in your feed within 45 milliseconds—no page refresh required. This is
powered by our WebSocket infrastructure that maintains persistent connections with all
active users.
The Apply button initiates the connection process, sending your profile to the match creator for review

Explanation:
The Discover Gamers page enables proactive player discovery beyond responding to match postings.
Each player card provides a snapshot of a potential teammate: Location: Geographic region
for latency considerations (displayed as country/region, not exact location for privacy) - Bio:
Player's self-description, gaming preferences, and personality - Gaming Icons: Visual
indicators of which games they play
The search and filter functionality (notshown but accessiblevia the top bar) allows filtering by:
- nearby(1km?5km?100km?)- Specific games - Skill tier ranges - Availability windows -
Region/timezone
This browsing experience mirrors social platforms but is purpose-built for gaming. Unlike
LinkedIn for professionals or Tinder for dating, Nexus is designed specifically for gamers
to find compatible teammates.
The "Connect" button initiates a connection request. Once both parties accept, they become
connectioned—able to message each other, see each other's onlinestatus, and invite each
other to matches and voice channels at any time.
